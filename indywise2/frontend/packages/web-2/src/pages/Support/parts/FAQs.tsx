            <strong>What can I expect from 1:1 sessions at IndyWise? </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Each session will be held according to the IndyWise Way of
            Mentoring, a community-led effort to standardize mentoring practices
            and allow for a professional mentoring experience. Our mentors are
            seasoned professionals, who will strive to provide you with the
            tools you need to succeed - be it training, advice, or job
            referencing.

              How can I book a 1:1 session with a mentor of my choice?{' '}
            </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Simply access our platform, search for the mentor whose skills,
            experience, and pricing matches your needs, and book a slot on your
            own timings. All the slots are committed to by the mentor and
            session cancellation is unlikely as we do check that their calendars
            are free when placing the booking.

          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>Can I access the session’s recordings later on?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Absolutely! One of the key features of our platform is enabling you
            to review the sessions you have had with mentors. This allows you to
            revise the learnings on-demand, and for free, and increases the
            value of the mentoring sessions themselves.

            <strong>How much in advance do I have to book my session?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Every mentor sets her/his own schedules, so you can choose to book a
            session up to 4 hours before it is due. We allow mentors to provide
            their schedules up to 60 days in advance.

            IndyWise is a platform done by mentors, for mentors. We connect
            mentees with mentors through a specifically built matchmaking
            algorithm that ensures you get mentees matching your selection
            criteria.
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            You can select your time availability, connect your calendars and
            approve or reject mentees’ bookings. You can also choose to engage
            in our Internship + mentoring life-changing programs for mentees,
            which do allow mentees an opportunity to achieve their dreams and
            secure the job they seek.

            <strong>What if I am not looking for monetary gains?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Should you choose to not pursue an income out of mentoring, any
            amount you raise through mentoring can be sent to charity or used
            for other non-profit purposes. IndyWise will also do an additional
            contribution to these causes on your behalf!

          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>How should I run a session? </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            We have a community-led way of mentoring and code of conduct
            available <strong>here</strong>. The code is revised often by our
            community and may change, but we will let you know in advance
            whenever that happens.

          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>How and when I get paid for my sessions?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            You can withdraw your earnings as often as you want. You can also
            set up monthly payments on a certain date and all your earnings will
            be sent out at that same time.
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Please note that you’ll need to pay a (minimal) fee for withdrawal,
            which is what our payment processor charges us. We would recommend
            withdrawing them once per month or in bulk, so as to minimize this
            fee.

          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>Is it mandatory to record every session?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Session recording is an integral part of IndyWise. It provides
            mentees and mentors a way to review the previous sessions and
            performances, to use these on their profile, and also allows us to
            review any complaints or negative feedback on them.
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            This occurs automatically, but either the mentee or the mentor need
            to agree to these being shared for us or any third party (including
            public usage) to be able to see them.

              How are mentors assigned to an Internship Program mentee?
            </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong> </strong>Each mentee will have a free assessment session
            which determines what (s)he requires to be able to secure a dream
            job. With this in hand, the mentor will be assigned to an internship
            program consisting of a mix between training, mentoring and
            certification.

            </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Typically a mentee will get 1 session per week. Each Internship
            duration is agreed at the beginning of the program, and mentors get
            guaranteed payments for every session held.

          <Text type="paragraph">
            As of now, all the mentoring classes are online due to the need for

            <strong>What is the process of rescheduling the session?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            As a mentor, you can freely cancel a session with a mentee, after
            which (s)he will receive a full refund. The mentee then will be able
            to go through the scheduling process again. Please keep in mind that
            repeated cancellations without justification may cause your account
            to be reviewed and, in the worst case, placed under suspension.
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>What if the mentee cancels the session?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            A mentee can cancel a session up to 6 hours before the session is
            due, which will imply an automatic refund. If he doesn’t attend the
            session or wants to cancel after this period of time, we won’t issue
            a refund and the mentor will get the fees accordingly.

            <strong>
              How should I prepare for my session to deliver the best exercise
              to my mentee?
            </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            You should analyze the mentee’s profile and, together with our
            community-led IndyWise Way of Mentoring, prepare the session so as
            to allow the Mentee to work on her/his desired skill.

          <Text type="paragraph">
            <strong>How do I get more mentees?</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Ratings, price and mentor card contents are usually the most
            important for mentees when deciding which mentor to choose. A good
            photo or video can often make the difference.

            </strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            As a mentor, you’ll be able to attend IndyWise’s events and
            participate in talks with the wider community. Also, the more
            engagement you get in the platform, the more earnings you will get.
