          <Text type="paragraph">
            All transactions for purchase of any Mentoring Services, Internship
            Program or any such other educational or elearning services have to
            be paid either online through IndyWise Payment Gateway Service
            Provider or offline, in which case payment details have to be
            manually entered in the system by the user or client.
            <br />
            <br />
            Users facing the problem of deduction of charges/payment (successful
            online payment) without getting the system payment record updated
            are required to submit the request for update of payment details
            along with invoice/transaction details separately by an email at
            payments@indywise.com. For failed online payment, or in case your
            credit card/debit card/payment account has been accidentally
            overcharged, the Payment Gateway Service Provider will be
            responsible for making a full automatic refund of the charged /
            overcharged amount to your account. In the reverse scenario, if the
            transaction amount during payment of service or products charges
            happens to be less than the actual fee amount, the Payment Gateway
            Service Provider will debit the outstanding amount from your Payment
            Account and notify you of the same.

            The amount due and payable to a mentor is agreed between the mentor
            and IndyWise at the start of our cooperation and before a mentor
            being listed on the platform. These fees will be listed on the

            and will be listed for 1 hr session.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will collect a percentage of the mentor fee directly from the
            payment received from the mentee and remit the remaining monies to
            the mentor as per the schedule outlined above and mentioned here
            again -

            mentioned in the agreement document of the program and mode chosen

          <br />
          <Text type="paragraph">
            You may decline a Mentee’s request for a mentorship session at your
            sole discretion. You must deploy commercially reasonable efforts to
            be present for a planned mentorship session with a Mentee. If you
            must cancel a planned mentorship session with a Mentee, a prior
            written notice of 24 hours is required. You agree and understand
            that we may revoke your Mentor status and suspend your account if we
            notice an unusual amount of cancellation or if we receive too many
            complaints. Mentees may cancel mentorship sessions up until 6 hrs
            before the scheduled session. In each case, the Mentor does not
            receive a payment for the canceled mentorship session. If a Mentee
            cancels several times, we recommend that you refuse future
            mentorship session requests altogether and that you reach out to us
            to inform us of the situation. If a mentee does not attend a paid
            call - or she/he cancels the session less than 6 hours before - and
            the mentor was present, this session will count as completed and the
            mentor will get the payment for such.
            <br />
            <br />
            All other other cases will fall under the cancellation policy which
            shall be amended and informed to you from time to time.

              Please note that the amount of refund will be limited to only the
              base amount of the services or products. Online convenience fee
              (if any) and applicable taxes will not be refunded, payable
              towards online payment processing. The refund amount will be
              refunded directly to the account from where the payment was made.

            In case of any user/client found to have paid more amount than
            prescribed, due to technical reason and on receiving the
            communication from the said applicant, the said extra payment, if
            found, shall be refunded by IndyWise to the same account from which

            us before the payouts are confirmed to Mentors. After a dispute is

            Mentors can refund mentees at any time before the Mentor receives

            mentees who are unsatisfied within reason during a live session. We
            reserve the right to pause or delay the payout for a session if a
            dispute arises, or when a dispute may potentially arise.
