      'He is bit confused about his role at present. Asked him to focus on the role and tasks given to him at present.

      'He is a good programmer and an individual contributor, that goes with his overall personality as well. \nAs part of this mentoring program he is getting aware of industry standards of Engineering process as well. \nBut it will depend on how fast he catches them and start including it in habit as well, then only it will show good results. \nAlso, the organisation must provide him the environment to grow like someone senior to do his code reviews.\n\nI like the part when he comes up with his questions during the sessions and that shows his willingness to learn. No doubt on that part that he want to learn and add new skills to him.\n\nHe also questions on need of things suggested to him. This is also positive, as this shows he is not the one who will adopt whatever the other person will say.\nBut at the same time he need to ensure that knowing more is right but doubting is not.\nFew things might look like overkill at his stage when he is just starting after college,\nhe need to keep in mind that these suggestions are being made mentor after a long industry experience.\n\nAs far as last session was concerned, we followed on the assignment that was given last time, i.e. writing test cases.\nHe had queries regarding why Test cases are important, and that was explained and he was agreeing that it serves a good purpose in engineering cycle.\n\nHe enquired about the project estimation techniques, and has been shared some articles about it.\n\nFor next session a target has been set to write test cases of his any project, I will check the test case execution and coverage report.\nI will also check how he is using the Sonar Lint plugin for static code analysis.',

      'He is dealing with a cocktail of strong urge to deliver more and quickly and whether he should follow the process which seems ideal, may slow down him a bit in shorter span of time but will definitely make him more refined and his deliverable bug free.\n\nI hope that in some time he will realise the importance of these good practices and guidelines established in the industry.',
