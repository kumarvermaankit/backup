          <Text bold type="h4">
            Start by getting to know your mentee
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Make sure you take time to get to know your mentee before you jump
            into the work of mentoring. Nothing of substance will happen until
            you establish a trusting relationship.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Establish working agreements</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Agreements lay the foundation of a mentoring relationship. Build-in
            basic structures about how you will work together moving forward.
            Make sure you and your mentee agree on ground rules.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Focus on developing robust learning goals</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            The purpose of mentoring is to learn. Learning is also the payoff.
            Make sure the mentee’s learning goals are worthy of your time and
            effort. Developing robust learning goals takes time and good
            conversation.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Balance talking and listening</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            It’s easy and natural to want to give advice, especially because
            you’ve “been there and done that.” But mentees want more than good
            advice. They want you to listen to their ideas as much as they want
            to hear what you have to say.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Ask questions rather than give answers</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Take the time to draw out a mentee’s thinking and get them to
            reflect on their own experience. Ask probing questions that
            encourage them to come up with their insights.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Engage in meaningful and authentic conversation</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Strive to go deeper than surface conversation. Share your successes
            and failures as well as what you are learning from your current
            mentoring relationship.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Check out assumptions and hunches</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            If you sense something is missing or not going well, you are
            probably right. Address issues as soon as possible. Simply stating,
            “I want to check out my assumption which is … ” will prevent you
            from assuming your mentee is on track.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Support and challenge your mentee</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Work on creating a comfortable relationship first before you launch
            into the uncomfortable stretch needed for deep learning. Mentees
            need to feel supported (comfortable) and yet be challenged (a little
            uncomfortable) to grow and develop.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Set the expectation of two-way feedback</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Candid feedback is a powerful trigger for growth and change. Set the
            expectation early on. Be prepared to offer candid feedback, balanced
            with compassion. Model how to ask for and receive good feedback by
            asking your mentee for specific feedback on your mentoring
            contribution.
          </Text>
          <Text bold type="h4">
            <strong>Check-in regularly to stay on track</strong>
          </Text>
          <Text type="paragraph">
            Keep connected and develop a pattern of regular engagement. Both
            partners need to be accountable for following through with
            agreements. By holding an open, honest conversation about how you’re
            doing and what you need to do to improve, you encourage mutual
            accountability and deepen the relationship.
