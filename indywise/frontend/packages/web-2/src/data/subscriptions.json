        "Final placements is one of the most crucial components of doing an MBA. As an aspirant or someone in the first year, you may think that this is not for you but your placement prep starts from Day 1 as an MBA Student. It isn't a one day process. The two years that you spend as an MBA student determine how your final placements go. Everything that you do or don't do during this time will determine your future. Make these two years count. It's what your b-school provides you with and what you make out of it.",
