I started working on OpenStack in 2015 and deployed my first all virtualized solutions for client in Latin America for Ericsson. \nIn 2017, Software Defined Networking solution testing started with existing Cloud infra worldwide. As SDWAN Solutions specialist I served as Pre Sales Engineer, to sell Nokia SDWAN solution to new clients. In 2019, I worked as Cloud Architect to plan and design Cloud Infra for Nokia clients in Europe and South East Asia.\nCurrently, working as NFV Engineer in Singapore, my role involves managing IT Cloud Datacenter, deploying CI/CD pipeline for Application owners and Administer Storage and Backup solutions.\nI am Certified in OpenStack via COA, SDN via OCSA and Kubernetes via CKA.",
